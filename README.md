# Music-Retail-Insight-
üé∂ Music Store Data Analysis
In this project I perform a comprehensive SQL analysis on a sample music store database. The goal is to answer a series of business questions ranging from beginner to advanced, providing actionable insights for the store's marketing and business strategy.

‚ú® Project Highlights
üîç Three Tiers of Queries: The project is structured into three distinct question sets, demonstrating proficiency across various SQL concepts:

Easy: Foundational queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to extract basic information.

Moderate: Intermediate queries involving complex JOIN operations, subqueries, and COUNT functions to answer more specific business questions.

Advanced: Sophisticated queries leveraging CTE (Common Table Expressions) and Window Functions to solve multi-step problems like ranking and finding the most popular items by category.

üìä Key Business Insights:

Identified the best-performing city and customer to target for promotions.

Found the top artists and genres to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

Determined the most popular music genre for each country to create targeted playlists.

Ranked customer spending by country to identify the top customers globally.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

SQL (PostgreSQL): The primary language for all queries.

Database Schema: A custom music_store schema with tables for employee, customer, invoice, track, album, artist, and genre.
